DOING: Repairing summary methods in order to evaluate newly generated data.

DONE: Finished automating stats.py, rewrote testing procedure to implement knn classifier, and automated running different levels of k and multiple data files.

TODO: Automation of stats.py succeeded on test cases but has failed when run on all the data from the experimental run.  Need to find bug and repair automated implementation of stats.py/abcd.py.

ROADBLOCKS: Failure of automated data analysis as alluded to in TODO section.  Not discovered until Monday night due to how long the experiment took to execute.

ADMIN: N/A

DISCUSSION: Output file tricks/limiting size of periodic output files and at what stage to save data.


###Report
No data analysis available due to the calls to stats.py and abcd.py erroring.  This report will be updated if the issue has been resolved by Thursday, otherwise results will be posted in next week's report.
